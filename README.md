# Overview

The baby boomers are set to retire soon in a relatively short time frame. This mass retirement is being called the "silver tsunami." To prepare for this, Pewlett-Hackard would like to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
